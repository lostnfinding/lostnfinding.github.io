									<h1>About LostnFinding</h1>
									<p>Welcome to the family.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Welcome to my corner of the web. I am a 26-year-old (Old, but I'm not that old), trying to figure out life one day at a time, and I have come to a realisation that a lot of us are in some ways similar, and if you just sang that OneRepublic lyric in your head, well, maybe we’re not so different after all. So, keeping my observations in mind, I am bringing this site about self-awareness and personal growth, but not from the glossy perspective of some guru or life coach. It's from the perspective of someone much like you: a regular human being muddling through one day at a time. I don't know it all. I haven't achieved some state of nirvana. What I do possess are genuine observations, lessons learned, tiny epiphanies, and a mounting curiosity regarding what it is like to live a more conscious, present life.</p>
								<p>Here, I'm truthful about what I've been experiencing—my successes and my failures. Whether it's working through emotions, developing healthier habits, breaking patterns, or just learning how to treat myself with more kindness, this blog is a space for honest, human growth.</p>
								<h2>Why I Started This Blog</h2>
								<p>I have spent years judging myself, researching self-awareness, questioning everything I believe, and attempting to learn more about who I am and how I wish to be. Doing so, I learned that the best understanding comes from experience—those quiet moments of realization after an argument, a major blunder, or an ostensibly minor choice.</p>
								<p>This blog is my effort to bring those moments to you, not as guidance, but as an invitation to think, to connect, and to grow with me.</p>
								<h2>What You’ll Find Here</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>Personal insights and reflections</li>
									<li>Authentic reflections on setbacks, aha moments, and shifts in perspective</li>
									<li>Practical habits and practices that were effective for me (and can be for you too)</li>
									<li>A kind, no-judgment path to self-awareness and growth</li>
								</ul>
								<p>If you're a person who's learning to show up for yourself, having trouble letting go of old ways, or just trying to get a little more from every day, you are in the right place. I want you to feel truly welcomed and safe here, free to speak and share your thoughts with me. I’m open to growth and different perspectives, and I’d be honoured if you choose to talk with me.</p>
