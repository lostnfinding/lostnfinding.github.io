								<p>Turning 26 felt like reaching an odd milestone. Not quite the carefree early 20s, not quite the seasoned late 20s. Somewhere in between, where self-awareness meets "what am I doing with my life" feelings. In hindsight, there are a couple of things that I wish I'd done before blowing at least the 25 candles of my life. But it has also been a quiet kind of awakening.</p>
								<p>It’s not dramatic, not loud. Just this gentle but persistent awareness that I’ve lived through a full quarter of a century — and that time, in all its confusing, beautiful chaos, is both a teacher and a thief. I’m not writing this from a place of regret, but rather from growth. From the warm feeling of realizing you didn't have to know it all, but perhaps it would have been beneficial to have a small idea sooner. At 25, 26, or really, wherever you currently are on this path, this is for you. These are the things I wish I had known, the things I'm learning now, and the things I'm still trying to understand.</p>
								<p>When I was younger, a teenager, I presume, I thought 25 was it. I plan to own a house by 25, have a family living in it, a successful career that pays me enough to support myself and the people I care about, and a red Jeep. I know! It sounds too much, but I also know that all of us have different dreams, different aims, and goals that we want to achieve. And once the high school is done and reality hits, we start falling into the trap of self-criticism and start doubting our whole idea of existence. “Dang! My friends are already married, they have children, they got better jobs than I,” and all such thoughts would haunt me, too. I used to think 25 was the age where one became "established" — career, love life, finances. But the reality is totally different; everybody's winging it, just on different levels of panic. </p>
								<p>The real reality is that you can start at any time. You can make new friends, try for a new job, and explore new hobbies. At 25, I believed I had to press on with what I had begun. At 26, I understand that reinventing is not failure — it's courage. Learning does not stop at graduation. I can read more, listen more, and always stay curious. The world is big, untamed and crazy — and there's always something new to learn, particularly about myself. I do not need to compare myself with anyone. Comparison is a sneaky thief. Watching friends get engaged, travel the world, or land six-figure jobs made me question my pace. But I’ve learned: rushing peace never brings peace. What’s mine won’t miss me.</p>
								<p>On the other hand, when I realised that I had been stuck and holding onto a self-destructive idea, I became critical of myself rather than giving myself a break and time to heal. Sometimes I would think back and shudder at who I was. Feels overwhelming, but on the other hand, I am changing. I had to forgive myself and understand that I was trying the best I could with what I knew. All I need is to move on with small steps, not sudden, dramatic declarations. I need to make the quiet, consistent choices — drinking water, calling my parents, journaling when I am overwhelmed — are the little things that can change the life. Life does not come with a timetable or a timeline, as long as you are trying, you are on the right path; your timeline is not late — it’s yours!</p>
								<p>But even after I had everything sorted, one thing kept lingering in my head, “What would the people say?” DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT, worry about what other people might think or say. Very few people would have thoughts that you should worry about, the people who really care about you. Nobody else thinks of you half as much as you think, not for the better at least. Seriously! Wear the clothes. Speak your truth. Enjoy yourself. So much of our magic is locked away by fear of judgment. Most people are too busy themselves to notice anyway. And if it's too hard, ask for help — it doesn't weaken you. Be it therapy, a hearty talk with a friend, or honestly saying "I don't know," asking for help is the strongest thing you can do. I am strong but I don't have to do it by myself.</p>
								<p>And last but not least, love yourself. As long as I thought I was heading where I needed to or had to, I was okay with myself, until I wasn’t. Until I started judging myself based on the results of the situations I could not control. I started becoming my own enemy. I hated what I was doing, what I was, and especially the way I looked. I almost became my rival. There were years I treated myself and my body like a project to fix, not a home to live in. I’m learning — slowly — to be kinder. To move, nourish, and rest without shame. I can not forget or forgive anyone if I don't start with myself. I need to be prioritized, and my joy needs to be prioritized by me before anyone else. I once pursued productivity as an end in itself. Now I know: laughter, sunlight, music, and rest are not distractions — they are the whole point.</p>
								<p>Now that I'm 26, I still have no clue what I'm doing half the time. I still doubt myself. I still do it wrong, forget my skincare, overanalyze people’s attitude, stay up past my bedtime, and wonder what is next. But I've learned personal development doesn't have to be loud or flawless. It can be simply showing up and being a little bit kinder today than you were yesterday, and that's enough! So if you're reading this and you're 22, 25, 30, or beyond — I want you to understand that it's okay that you don't have your life figured out yet. Growth is messy, and healing is not a straight line. But you're doing better than you think. Keep trying your best.</p>
								<p>Here's to moving forward — even when we don't know.</p>
								<p>With love,</p>
								<p>A still-learning 26-year-old</p>
